[Kanji Samurai](https://ecortegoso.github.io/kanjisamurai) is an app for studying japanese kanji.

## Why yet another japanese app?

There are plenty of very nice kanji learning apps out there avaialble online. My motivation to create another one was that I can simply use the exact lessons that I need to study to pass my exams. Also, because I always had as a personal goal to be able to publish an app in the app store, and this was just the right idea to do it. In addition, I didn't find any kanji apps that used voice recognition to do reading exams, so at least this point was original.

## What else

The app is available only [for iOS devices](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/kanji-samurai/id1607687972) at the moment (because this is what I knew how to do), but some of my colleagues at [Escola Oficial d'Idiomes de Barcelona](https://www.eoibd.cat/en/) did ask to prepare an Android version. So I'm speeding up my learning for Android development to port the app to Google Play.

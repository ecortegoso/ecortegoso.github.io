I'm a hobbyist developer living in Barcelona. This means I work on something different for a living. After starting to learn japanese few years ago at the [Escola Oficial d'Idiomes de Barcelona](https://www.eoibd.cat/en/) I developed the idea of creating [my own app]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2022-03-25-kanji-samurai %}) for learning Japanese kanji. So this was the starting point of this website.

[Jisho Search](https://ecortegoso.github.io/jishosearch) is an utility app for searching in awesome [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org) handwritten japanese.

## Why did I make it?

As a japanese student you need to go to a dictionary at all times. When you are in a hurry, I found myself opening jisho.org website in my mobile phone, switching the keyboard to Japanese, and then querying the word I'm looking for. This happens if you know the hiragana. When you see a kanji that you don't know, you need to start searching for kanjis by radicals, then select the different characters in the word to finally run your query... sometimes this becomes tiresome.

While programming my other app [Kanji Samurai]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2022-03-25-kanji-samurai %}), I ended app by use Google's IME api to recognize handwriting japanese for the functionality of writing exams. I quickly thought that using the same blackboard for a dictionary search will speed up things a lot.
